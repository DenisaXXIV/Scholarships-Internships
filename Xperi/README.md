  <h1>Deep Learning</h1>
</div>
<p>It is a 3-month program for students with intermediate programming knowledge, one year before graduation.</p>

<div align="center">
<h2>Why Deep Learning?</h2>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Massive amounts of data and computational power have allowed us to bring AI to a whole new level</li>
<li>AI is considered to be the new electricity</li>
<li>Will enable a range of cool new applications from self-driving cars to smarter personal assistants, to house robots and ultimately to AGI (artificial general intelligence)</li>
<li>An amazing field to work in</li>
</ul>
